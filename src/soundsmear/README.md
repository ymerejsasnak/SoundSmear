 
TO DO:

-!! CLICK IN SOME SOUNDS WHEN LOOPING: OFF BY ONE SOMEWHERE WHEN WORKING WITH FRAMES?


-need error checking for if 1 or other source sound isnt loaded?
(or maybe just load in default sounds)

-refactor smear process in many spots (repeated code, etc)

-options to set start and end, and add variation (ie paste partial output)
-add ability to save output
-options for panning(?) (scale volume in each channel) and pitch variation per-paste
-ways to slowly change many above settings for morphing sound (maybe do it 'palindromically' to retain loopability)

-add some more options for timestretch-like effects (more control over offset/start/end)


-eventually remove beads and do wav reading/writing myself?
