 
TO DO:

-!! CLICK IN SOME SOUNDS WHEN LOOPING: OFF BY ONE SOMEWHERE WHEN WORKING WITH FRAMES?

-figure way to scale volume properly depending on # of iters and length of output
-options to set start and end, and add variation (ie paste partial output)
-add ability to load multiple input files to randomly draw from, store multiple output files before saving
-add ability to save files of course (single or all)
-options for panning and pitch variation per-paste
-ways to slowly change many above settings for morphing sound (maybe do it 'palindromically' to retain loopability)

-add some more options for timestretch-like effects 


-eventually remove beads and do wav reading/writing myself?
