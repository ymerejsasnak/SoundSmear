 
TO DO:

-!! CLICK IN SOME SOUNDS WHEN LOOPING: OFF BY ONE SOMEWHERE WHEN WORKING WITH FRAMES?

-need error checking for if 1 or other source sound isnt loaded?
-refactor smear process (repeated code)

-figure way to scale volume properly depending on # of iters and length of output
-options to set start and end, and add variation (ie paste partial output)
- store multiple output files before saving??
-add ability to save files of course (single or all)
-options for panning and pitch variation per-paste
-ways to slowly change many above settings for morphing sound (maybe do it 'palindromically' to retain loopability)

-add some more options for timestretch-like effects (more control over offset/start/end)


-eventually remove beads and do wav reading/writing myself?
