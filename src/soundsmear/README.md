-!! CLICK IN SOME SOUNDS WHEN LOOPING: OFF BY ONE SOMEWHERE WHEN WORKING WITH FRAMES?

-!! doesn't work correctly if input files aren't 44.1khz, etc


-need(?) to use interpolation for frame values for better sound when changing pitch

-use better panning law, not linear

-need to clean up audiomanager and smearprocess!

-add in-window display of messages currently printed to console

-eventually remove beads and do wav reading/writing/playing myself?
