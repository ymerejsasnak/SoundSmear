 
TO DO:

-write descriptive readme
-fix up UI
-implement loading/processing of non-44.1khz files
-use interpolation when changing pitch/rate so it sounds better?
-use better panning law for random panning (currently linear)
-some more code cleanup/refactoring/readability stuff to make it easy to reuse for other sound tools
-take care of any remaining issues with loading/playing/stopping/processing sounds at the wrong time
-maybe eventually remove beads and do my own wav reading/writing/playing???
-!! STILL CLICK IN PURER SOUNDS WHEN LOOPING, BUT CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT
