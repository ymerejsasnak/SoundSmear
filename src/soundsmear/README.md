 
TO DO:

-!! CLICK IN SOME SOUNDS WHEN LOOPING: OFF BY ONE SOMEWHERE WHEN WORKING WITH FRAMES?


-need to clean up audiomanager and smearprocess!


-options to set start and end, and add variation (ie paste partial output)
-add button to save output
-options for panning(?) (scale volume in each channel) and pitch variation per-paste
-ways to slowly change many above settings for morphing sound (maybe do it 'palindromically' to retain loopability)

-add some more options for timestretch-like effects (more control over offset/start/end)


-eventually remove beads and do wav reading/writing/playing myself?
